Loading ballgown and associated packages
```{r}
library(ballgown)
library(genefilter)
library(dplyr)
library(devtools)
```



Read in pheno data
```{r}
ballgownPhenodata <- read.csv("~/hisatAnalysis/ballgownPhenodata.csv")
```

Read in ballgown data (counts)
```{r}
ballgownData <- ballgown(dataDir = "/home/mcity599/hisatAnalysis/ballgown/", samplePattern = "sample", pData = ballgownPhenodata)
# Running as per the publication instructions generates this error:
## Rows of pData did not seem to be in the same order as the columns of the expression data. Attempting to rearrange pData...Error in ballgown(dataDir = "/home/mcity599/hisatAnalysis/ballgown/",  : 
##  first column of pData does not match the names of the folders containing the ballgown data.

ballgownData <- ballgown(dataDir = "/home/mcity599/hisatAnalysis/ballgown/", samplePattern = "")
# Can successfully load the ballgown information by itself

# The problem can be seen here:
list.files("/home/mcity599/hisatAnalysis/ballgown/")

## I looked into re-sorting one of these files, but that seems dangerous should I ever need to re-analyse or forget to re-sort at a later date. Instead I've renamed the sample files as sampleA, sampleB
# Repeat the process above, and it now functions properly

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
